= Getting your photos into S3 =

You must resize and upload your photos manually, at present. Tools such as [http://www.irfanview.com/ IrfanView] and [https://jets3t.dev.java.net/ Jets3t] make batch conversions and uploads very easy and quick.

You'll need to choose a bucket and a path. If you'd like to store your photos in the location `http://BIG-BUCKET.s3.amazonaws.com/things/my_pictures/`, you must create a bucket named `BIG-BUCKET`.

sappho uses a very specific directory structure. Within your chosen path, you'll have three folders: `a`, `b`, and `c`.
  * `a` contains full resolution images.
  * `b` contains images with a long side of 640px.
  * `c` contains images with a long side of 120px.

If you're uploading one image named `larz.jpg`, you'll need it in three sizes, all with the same filename, in each of the folders `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Once you get the three sizes uploaded for a given file name, the photo should appear when you visit `/manage/import.php`.

= Automated scripts =

Perhaps you'd like to code some shell scripts that automatically resize and upload your photos! That would be great!

Such scripts may become a part of this project's code base, when we have time to code them.
